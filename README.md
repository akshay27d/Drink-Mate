# Drink-Mate
A responsible drinking app

This android app will serve as a way to count alcoholic drinks and estimate blood alcohol content by taking into account sex, weight, number of drinks, and time elapsed. 

This project was prompted by my recognition of unsafe drinking habits on college campuses; hopefully, this app will curb risky behavior by keeping track of the number of drinks taken and warning drinkers when their BAC is nearing unsafe levels.
